# ‚òÄÔ∏è2022_Summer_Internship on Hands-on Introduction to Object Detection

## TITE: A Case-Study on Trypanosome Parasite Detection
### Main Task Description
Hands on deep dives into the inner working of deep learning objectdetectors using two application areas:Trypanosomiasis screening in microscopy images and peritoneal tumor detection in surgical images.

## What do I do during this internship?

Use: Pytorch and Detectron 2

### Organization of this internship

This program is constructed with two things: self-study, task and final project. 

Firstly, I was introduced to the code-related Object Detection by accessing tutorials as links with code examples accompanied by explanations and lecture videos, enablint me to become familiar with and understanding the subject matter. 

Subsequently, I was given tasks to apply and practice the knowledge I had gained from the tutorials online sources and video lectures.

At the final week, as describing the main task description, I annotated parasites in given medical images as json files with Roboflow and proceeded from preparing data to evaluation with Detectron 2.

### Then, How do I study during self-study?

In essence, I utilized Google Colab to execute the provided code in real and write my learned knowledge and findings from googling and given resources into practical code implementation.

**example**

After looking over the provided code, I made an effort to understand and investigate how each command functions and is structured, and I have documented my findings below the code.

With comments, I documented the flow of the code and what the code does.

### Work Flow This Program

#### Week 1: Introduction to PyTorch   

**Self-Study**

This week, I was devolved into the fundamentals of working with tensor data, understanding its structure and operations.

Furthermore, I also covered generally the essential steps and used items involved in training, including data processing, loss functions, 
optimaziation techinques and model estimation with code LeNet model and CIFAR 10 dataset.

**Task**

This task proceeded by composing two reports: one is a response to answers and writing what I learned through Video about Open CV and Computer Vision (3 hours).

* Report 1 in response to questions: The questions are asked mainly about comparing ANN, CNN, ML. To answer this question and understand, I tried to read several papers to understand.

* Report 2 for writing about the video: the video serves tutorial on utilizing code and working with OpenCV, demonstrating its practical cases in the real world. So, this report summarized the lecture video in one page. (you can see my report in this repository + I saved the file as markdown, named as Week1_Answer_question_and_report.md).

#### Week 2: Image Classification Model Construction

**Self-Study**

Based on knowledge learned before, in earnest treated code of image classification model construction with CIFAR10 and simple Convolutional Neural Network model. During the process from data processing to evaluation, I immersed myself in how PyTorch is used. Through this journey, I gained a comprehensive understanding of how to structure the syntex of used commands in code and function for these tasks. Furthermore, I grasped logistics behid the code's flow, comprehending the rationale behind each step in the process. 

**Task**

Using what I studied from self-study, two tasks are provided: basic task and advanced task.
At the basic task, I filled up code in given incomplete template code for training yet another interesting image dataset.
At advanced tasks, referring to the model trained in Task 1 as the CIFAR-10 pre-trained model,build up code to preparing customized data and develop Convolutional Neural Network model for classification in real with PyTorch and several library like numpy, matplot, and so on.

#### Week 3: Image Classification Model Construction with Customized Model and Data

**Self-Study and Task**

This week is constructed with integration of self-study and tasks. 
Through an attached link to a tutorial on object detection from 'scratch', convert the tutorial code to execute and run on Colab

The target is two-fold:

i) To learn how to convert a code to run on Colab

ii) To gain a more fundamental understanding of how object detection works.

#### Week 4: Final project Trypanosmome Parasite Detection Model Construction

The final project is a collaborative effort, structured as a team project with the goal of enhancing the performance of a Faster RCNN parasite detection model through preprocessing applied to medical images. we were provided with 2000 images with parasites and annotated them into JSON file using Roboflow. In contrast to previous approach, this project mainly utilizes Detectron 2.
