# ‚òÄÔ∏è2022_Summer_Internship on Hands-on Introduction to Object Detection

## TITE: A Case-Study on Trypanosome Parasite Detection
### Main Task Description
Hands on deep dives into the inner working of deep learning objectdetectors using two application areas:Trypanosomiasis screening in microscopy images and peritoneal tumor detection in surgical images.

### What do I do during this course?

Use: Pytorch and Detectron 2

**All of study for the internship revolves around interpreting and analyzing provided code.**

#### Work Flow This Program

#### Week 1: Introduction to PyTorch   

**Self-Study**

This week, I was devlved into the fundentals of working with tensor data, understanding its constructure and operstions.

Furthermore, I also covered generaly the essential steps and used items involved in traing, including data processing, dening loss functions, optimaziation techinques and model estimation with code LeNet model and CIFAR 10 dataset.

**Task**

This task proceeded by composing two reports: one is response to answers and wrting what I learn through Video about Open CV and Computer Vision (3 hours).

* Report 1 in response to questions: The questions are asked mainly about compairing ANN, CNN, ML. To answer this quesition and understand, I tried to read several papers to understand 

* Report 2 for writing about video: the video serves tutorial on utilizing code and workgin with OpenCV, demonstrating its practical cases in real world. So, this report sumerized the lecture video in one page. (you can see the report in this re

#### Week 2: Image Classification Model Construction

**Self-Study**


**Task**
With using what I sutudied from self-study, 

#### Week 3: Image Classification Model Construction with Customized Model and Data

**Self-Study**

This week 

**Task**


#### Week 4: Trypanosmome Parasite Detection Model Construction
